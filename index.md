# IPFS Tutorials

## About

These are some sketches for a redesign of the IPFS Tutorials. This redesign is mainly about structuring the tutorials as learning modules with clear learning objectives. The proposed structure is largely inspired by the [Railsbridge Curriculum](http://docs.railsbridge.org/intro-to-rails/) and the notion that educational materials should be structured around [Learning Objectives](http://www.ucdenver.edu/faculty_staff/faculty/center-for-faculty-development/Documents/Tutorials/Assessment/module3/index.htm).
The Hydra Project has used this structure very successfully to create & maintain tutorials like [Dive into Hydra](https://github.com/projecthydra/hydra/wiki/Dive-into-Hydra).

These tutorials can serve as the basis for both self-directed online learning and in-person workshops & trainings.   

I wasn't sure how to build the existing code for the ipfs/examples page so I'm using the [jekyll-curriculum-template](https://github.com/flyingzumwalt/jekyll-curriculum-template).


### How to structure courses in the curriculum

For more info about the Course/Module/Activity structure used here, read the [Template Curriculum](https://flyingzumwalt.github.io/jekyll-curriculum-template/curriculum/)

### Serve these pages anywhere with Jekyll

In the root of your curriculum content, run

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

See the [Setting up your GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/) for more info and troubleshooting.
