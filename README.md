# Jekyll Curriculum Template

## Development

The Curriculum Template has two branches, but only one is used for active development.

- `master` for development.  **All pull requests should be submitted against `master`.**
- `gh-pages` for our hosted site, which includes the [pool/hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde) jekyll template. **Please avoid using this branch.**
